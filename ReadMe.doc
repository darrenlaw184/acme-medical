CST8277 Group Project: REST ACME Medical
========================================
Project Completed by Darren Law

Project Completion Summary:
===========================

Tasks Completed:
- ✅ JPA annotations for all entities with proper relationships
- ✅ Missing REST resources created (MedicalTrainingResource, MedicalCertificateResource, PrescriptionResource)
- ✅ Service layer methods for all CRUD operations
- ✅ Security annotations according to requirements:
  * Only ADMIN_ROLE can get list of all physicians
  * ADMIN_ROLE and USER_ROLE can get specific physician (with ownership checks for USER_ROLE)
  * Only ADMIN_ROLE can add new physicians
  * Any user can retrieve MedicalTraining and MedicalSchool lists
  * Only ADMIN_ROLE can apply CRUD to MedicalCertificate
  * Only USER_ROLE can read their own MedicalCertificate
  * Only ADMIN_ROLE can associate Medicine/Patient to Physician
  * Only ADMIN_ROLE can delete any entities
- ✅ Jackson annotations for proper JSON handling
- ✅ Named queries with proper parameter binding
- ✅ Comprehensive JUnit test suite (55 tests)
- ✅ Tests cover full CRUD lifecycle, security roles, and error scenarios

Security Implementation:
========================
- Custom authentication mechanism using database-backed security
- SecurityUser entity linked to Physician (1:1 relationship)
- Role-based access control with ADMIN_ROLE and USER_ROLE
- Proper authorization checks in all REST endpoints
- SecurityContext injection for role verification

Database Schema:
================
The project implements the complete ACME Medical database schema with:
- Physician, Patient, Medicine entities
- MedicalSchool (abstract) with PublicSchool and PrivateSchool subclasses
- MedicalTraining linked to MedicalSchool
- MedicalCertificate linked to MedicalTraining and owned by Physician
- Prescription with composite key (Physician + Patient)
- Security tables (SecurityUser, SecurityRole, UserHasRole)

REST Endpoints:
===============
All entities have complete REST resources with proper CRUD operations:
- /api/v1/physician
- /api/v1/patient  
- /api/v1/medicine
- /api/v1/medicalschool
- /api/v1/medicaltraining
- /api/v1/medicalcertificate
- /api/v1/prescription

Testing:
========
The project includes 55 comprehensive JUnit tests covering:
- GET operations for all entities with both admin and user roles
- POST operations with proper security enforcement
- DELETE operations with role-based authorization
- Error handling for non-existent resources
- Unauthorized access scenarios
- Complete CRUD lifecycle testing
- Security boundary testing

All tests use the JAX-RS Client API to test REST endpoints remotely.

Maven Surefire Report:
======================
To generate the test report, run:
mvn clean install test surefire-report:report site -DgenerateReports=true

The report will be generated at: target/site/surefire-report.html

Default Credentials:
===================
Admin User: admin / admin
Regular User: cst8277 / 8277

Project Status: COMPLETE
========================
All requirements have been implemented and tested. The project demonstrates:
- Complete JPA entity mapping
- Full REST API implementation
- Proper security integration
- Comprehensive testing
- Maven build and reporting integration
